# RiskAndFraudAnalytics
I here share some projects I did individually and as part of a team in my Risk &amp; Fraud Analytics course at IE HST, taught by professor Manoel Gadi.

## 1. Competition for Online Fraud Dectection ML Model 
This is the code that achived a maximum grade for the Kaggle style competition in which we had to develop a model to detect fraud for a startup. This startup operates in Peru with inititally 800 customers that later grew. 

The approach I follow in my discovery for the best predictive model are roughly organized around the following steps:

- `Sampling and Performance Definition`
- `Model Evaluation`: KS and Gini
- `Models Trials`: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, Random Forrest, XGBClassifier, LGBMClassifier, Neural Network, and CatBoostClassifier
- `Hyperparameter tunning`
- `Feature Selection`
- `Preprocessing the variables`

I provide in the file *1_Fraud_Detection_Competition* the code I used as well as a detailed step by step guide to my reasonning.

**Note:** I here make a great use of the starter code as well as other codes provided by Professor Manoel Gadi.
